## Introduction

The frontend web of [OT-Microservices](https://github.com/OT-MICROSERVICES) stack is a REACTJS based application which is acts as a user interface of the stack. This application supports cross-platform and can be executed on multiple operating systems as long as a JavaScript runtime environment is available. 

ReactJS is a modern, flexible, and high-performance JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It focuses on creating component-based UIs with efficient updates

## Architecture

The Frontend Web integrates with Employee API, Attendance API and Salary API for the functioning of OT-Microservices stack. 

---

## Pre-requisites

- **REST APIs**: The frontend application have dependencies on REST APIs of OT-Microservices like Employee, Attendance and Salary APIs which need to be integrated and configured.
- **Node.js**: Provides the runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server-side and building and packaging React code.
- **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: Used to install, manage and run dependencies(java script libraries and tools) that the application depends upon.
NPM helps you manage these dependencies by adding them to a package.json file, which lists all the libraries our application depends on.

## Features

The Frontend API provides several important features and design patterns ensuring the application is scalable, maintainable, and delivers a good user experience. 

- **ReactJS based web framework** - OT-Microservices Frontend application is uses ReactJS for the complete web page based operations
- **Independent Deployment**: Microservices in the frontend can be treated as micro-frontends, allowing different parts of the UI to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Integration of Multiple Microservices**: Each micro-frontend can be responsible for consuming data from different Microservices APIs, and the frontend can stitch them together on the client side.
- **Modular and Reusable Components**: As ReactJS is built around components, so microservices frontend have reusable, modular components that can be shared across different parts of the application.
- **Encapsulation**: Each component has its own state and logic, allowing developers to work with isolated, manageable pieces of the UI.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component of frontend focused on a single responsibility (e.g., displaying data, user interaction, etc.), and complex components are broken down into smaller sub-components.
- **Unit Testing** - For application functionality verification in unit testing, uses testing frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library to test individual components and ensure they function correctly.
- **Test case integration** For End-to-End Testing, Cypress or Playwright can be used to simulate full user interactions and ensure that the frontend works correctly with the microservices.

## Key Benefits of ReactJS for Frontend API

- **Fast Rendering & Performance**: React’s virtual DOM and efficient update process lead to faster and smoother rendering.
- **Easy Debugging and Testing**: React's declarative UI, along with developer tools, simplifies debugging and testing.
- **Component Reusability**: React components are reusable and modular, which enhances code maintainability.
- **Scalable Architecture**: React scales well for both small and large applications, making it suitable for both startups and enterprise applications.
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: React Router is a powerful library for managing navigation and routing in React applications.
- **Dynamic Routing**: It allows for dynamic routing based on URL paths, enabling users to navigate between different views or pages without refreshing the entire application.
- **Strong Community and Ecosystem**: React’s large community and ecosystem of third-party libraries help developers find solutions to common problems.

## Conclusion

The Frontend API is a robust microservice designed to manage the user interface for within the OT Microservices architecture. It integrates seamlessly with the Attendance API, Employee API and Salary API. The API is dynamic and interactive as it is based on ReactJS, which is a high-performance JavaScript library

This API is intended to serve as a backbone for UI related services, providing easy extensibility and maintainability.
