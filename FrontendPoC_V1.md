## Introduction
In [OT-Microservices](https://github.com/OT-MICROSERVICES) stack, the Frontend API built on ReactJS which integrates with other APIs of the application.

## Purpose
The frontend web is a REACTJS based application serving as user interface of [OT-Microservices](https://github.com/OT-MICROSERVICES) stack. This application supports cross-platform and can be executed on multiple OS as long as a JavaScript runtime environment is available. 
A ReactJS based web framework for the complete web page based operations.
Test case integration for application functionality verification.

## System Requirements
| System Requirement | Minimum Requirement | 
|----------|----------|
| **OS**  | Ubuntu or other Linux-based OS | 
| **Disk space**|  20 GB | 
| **RAM**  |  4 GB|
| **Processor**  |  Dual-core recommended|
| **Instance Type**  |  t2.small|

 
## Pre-requisites

| Dependencies | Details| 
|----------|----------|
| **REST APIs**  | The frontend application have dependencies on other REST API of OT-Microservices like Employee, Attendance and Salary APIs which need to be configured. | 
| **Node.js**|  Provides the runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server-side and building and packaging React code | 
| **NPM (Node Package Manager)**  |  Used to install, manage and run dependencies(java script libraries and tools) that the application depends upon. NPM helps manage these dependencies by adding them to a package.json file, which lists all the libraries our application depends on.|

## Installation Steps
For the Frontend PoC, follow the steps mentioned below:

![alt text](image-3.png)

1. **Update Packages**
First step is to update the packages (instance type t2.small, volume 20GB)
```sh 
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt list --upgradable
```

2. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/OT-MICROSERVICES/frontend.git
    cd frontend
    ```

3. **Install nodejs:**

```sh 
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nodejs -y
    nodejs -v
```

4. **Install npm:**

```sh 
    sudo apt install npm
    npm -v
```
5. **Create directory name `public`** into frontend directory and create `index.html` file Where we have add following content.

```
html<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>React Frontend App</title>
</head>

<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <h1>Welcome to Frontend Web Page</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

6. **Edit the package.json file:**
In the `package.json` change the ip address with the public ip address in the proxy with specified port.


7. **Build the application:**
For building the application. we can use make command from the Makefile.

```sh
    make build
```

To resolve this error, run the following command
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider

8. **Run the application:**
The command to run the application is as follows

```sh
    npm start
```

## Conclusion
The Frontend API is a robust microservice designed to manage the user interface within the OT-Microservices architecture. The API is dynamic and interactive as it is based on ReactJS, which is a high-performance JavaScript library.
