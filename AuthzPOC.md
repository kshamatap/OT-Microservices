Authorization refers to the permissions and access control mechanisms that define what actions authenticated users can perform on the repository, branches, and other resources. The techniques for authorization in VCS vary in granularity, flexibility, and complexity.

Authorization in Version Control Systems (VCS) is a critical aspect of software development and collaboration. It governs who can access, modify, and control the codebase, ensuring that the right individuals or teams have the appropriate permissions. Without proper authorization, a VCS can become vulnerable to security risks, data loss, and inefficient workflows.

## Authorization Strategies
Authorization strategies in version control systems (VCS) are methods used to control who can access, modify, or perform certain actions within a repository or project. These techniques help ensure that only authorized users can make changes, view the history, or manage repositories, providing security and maintaining the integrity of the codebase.

There are Various Authorization strategies in VCS to control access to repositories and ensure secure collaboration within development teams. 

Below mentioned are some of the common techniques: 

### User Authentication

- Before any authorization can happen, users must first be authenticated. The following methods are commonly used for user authentication:

  - **Username/Password**: The basic method where users provide a valid username and password.
  - **SSH Keys**: A more secure method for authentication, especially for distributed systems like Git.
  - **OAuth/ OpenID**: Allows users to log in via third-party services like GitHub, Google, or other accounts.
- **Security Level**: Low. Passwords can be easily compromised if not managed securely.
- **Use Case**: Typically used in less secure environments or when other methods are not feasible.


### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- RBAC involves assigning users specific roles that define their access permissions to repositories or branches. Platforms like **GitHub**, **GitLab**, and **Bitbucket** provide role-based access to help manage these permissions.
Common roles include:

  - **Administrator**: Full access to all repositories and administrative features.
  - **Contributor**: Can push changes to repositories but cannot modify settings or user permissions.
  - **Viewer/Read-Only**: Can view repositories but cannot make changes.
-  **Security Level**: High (strong role-based separation)
-  **Use Case**: Managing user access to repositories or actions based on predefined roles (e.g., restrict write access to developers).


### Access Control Lists (ACLs)

- ACLs provide more granular control over who can access specific files or directories. Permissions are granted to individual users or groups.

- **Read, Write, Delete** permissions can be set at the file or directory level.
- Used by systems like **Perforce**, **SVN**, and Git (via extensions or server-side configuration).
-  **Security Level**: Medium to High
-  **Use Case**: Defines permissions at a more granular level (e.g., on specific directories, files, or branches)

### Branch Protection Rules

- Branch protection rules control how critical branches (e.g., `main`, `develop`) can be updated:

- **Require Pull Requests**: Prevent direct commits to protected branches, forcing code reviews.
- **Status Checks**: Enforce checks (e.g., passing tests) before code can be merged.
- **Code Review Approvals**: Require peer reviews and approval before merging changes.
-  **Security Level**: High
-  **Use Case**: Restricts actions on specific branches (e.g., requires pull request reviews before merging).

### Token-Based Authentication (Personal Access Tokens)

Personal Access Tokens (PATs) are an alternative to passwords, often used for API access or when interacting with VCS through CLI tools. Key features include:

- More secure than passwords.
- Scoped to limit access to specific repositories or actions.
- Useful in automation scripts and CI/CD pipelines.
-  **Security Level**: High
-  **Use Case**: Uses access tokens for API authentication and Git operations.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

- Two-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent via SMS or an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator).
-  Enforces stronger security for user accounts.
-  **Security Level**: Very High
-  **Use Case**: Requires users to provide two forms of authentication (password + second factor)

### IP Whitelisting or Geo-Restrictions

- This technique limits repository access to specific **IP addresses** or geographic regions. It can add an additional layer of security by restricting access to trusted networks.

- Can be used to enforce security for **private repositories**.
-  **Security Level**: Very High
-  **Use Case**

### Repository-Level Permissions

- Repository-level permissions determine who can access specific repositories and what actions they can perform:

  - **Read** access: View the repository's code and history.
  - **Write** access: Push changes to the repository.
  - **Admin** access: Manage repository settings, permissions, and more.

-  **Security Level**: High
-  **Use Case**: Grants or restricts access to specific repositories within a VCS, allowing users to be assigned different levels of access (e.g., Admin, Write, Read) for individual repositories
